    "response": "PPEI addressed both the tuning requirements and the Autocal error. On December 2, 2019, Jake Fryer provided a revised tune file (CSP5_T_170_v1.2_2.ctz) to accommodate the non-VGT turbo and 2nd gen manifold swap, along with a PDF guide for loading tunes. For the Autocal error code 0502, Zac Fontenot offered remote assistance via TeamViewer on December 12, 2019, and requested Dagan\u2019s contact information to facilitate troubleshooting. On June 17, 2024, Zach Lejeune supplied the stock file (3C6UD5CLXCG122557_STOCK.ctz) and detailed instructions to resolve potential software or firmware issues, advising Dagan to reinstall the EFI Live software from EFIlive.com, update the Autocal firmware, flash the stock file, and then apply the tune. Additional resources, including configuration instructions and a BBX file, were provided to ensure proper setup. No explicit confirmation of resolution (e.g., successful tune application or error code resolution) was included in the conversation, suggesting that further customer follow-up or verification may be required.
