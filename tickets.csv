Can it be added additionally if I already have a tuned truck? Or does it have to be and engine and trans tune together? 2014 ram 3500 6.7 with ez Lynk tunes already. Been waiting for your Aisin tuning for a long time. The stock Aisin shifting makes me wish I bought a G56 truck the way I always have to shift for it when towing heavy!

Dustin Uhde has a 2014 Ram 3500 6.7L Cummins with existing EZ Lynk engine tunes. On April 10, 2025, he asked if PPEI’s Aisin transmission tuning can be added separately or requires a combined engine/trans tune. He’s frustrated with the stock Aisin shifting, especially when towing heavy, and wants better control.
The Solution (Simplified):
Compatibility:
Logan confirmed the Aisin TCM (Transmission Control Module) is independent of the engine tuning, so PPEI’s trans tune can be added without affecting Dustin’s EZ Lynk engine tunes.
Process:
Dustin purchases the Aisin tuning from PPEI’s site (https://ppei.com/products/2013-2018-ram-6-7l-cummins-aisin-transmission-tuning-by-ppei).
He adds tuning@ppei.com as a technician in the EZ Lynk app.
PPEI sends the TCM tune, which gets added to his ECU profiles list in the app.
Dustin loads the trans tune via EZ Lynk, just like his engine tunes, improving shifting (especially for towing).
Outcome:
The tune should resolve his shifting complaints, giving smoother or more controlled gear changes without manual intervention.
Next Step:
Dustin buys the Aisin tune from the link, adds tuning@ppei.com to EZ Lynk, and loads the tune PPEI sends to fix his towing shift issues."
265650000144908128,PPEI Tuning - Order #N16202,2011 - 2019 Ford 6.7L Powerstroke 6R140 | Transmission Tuning by PPEI,"The Problem (Simplified):
Hard Shifting: Aldo Abastta reported on April 9, 2025, that his 2011-2019 Ford 6.7L Powerstroke with a 6R140 transmission shifts hard from 1st to 2nd and slightly from 2nd to 3rd, despite running a 40hp tow tune. The truck runs well otherwise.
Previous Tuning Issue: On April 3, 2025, Aldo noted prior Mini Maxx tunes may have altered the TCM, so the TCM read file (TCM READ1.hpt) he sent might not be stock, potentially affecting PPEI’s tune.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Tune Setup:
Aldo sent a TCM read file and info log (VCMSuiteInfo.txt) on April 3, 2025.
Stef built a new TCM tune from scratch (not using the read file, as it wasn’t stock) and sent it on April 3 (noted as a bypassed “BP” file).
Hard Shifting Fix:
Aldo reported the hard shifting on April 9, 2025.
Logan asked for a data log and confirmed the current engine tuning (40hp tow tune) on April 10.
Logan sent a PIDs file (6.7 ford channels2.Channels.Channels.xml) and detailed logging instructions for HP Tuners VCM Scanner, requesting logs of idle, part/heavy throttle, cruising, and the hard shifting issue.
Next Action:
Aldo records logs as instructed (using HP Tuners; EFI Live also an option) capturing the 1-2 and 2-3 shift issues.
Sends logs to PPEI for review.
PPEI adjusts the TCM tune to smooth out the harsh shifts based on log data.
Next Step:
Aldo records and sends the data logs using HP Tuners VCM Scanner, and PPEI revises the TCM tune to fix the hard shifting."
265650000131232309,PPEI Tuning - Order #N12339,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Rough Shifts and Flares: Riley Dixon reported on September 3, 2024, that his LML Duramax (specific year/model not provided, VIN unknown) with a PPEI TCM tune (ordered ~July 2024) exhibits rough shifts and flares, particularly in 3-4 (500-800 RPM jump) and 5-6 (100-200 RPM jump) gears, worsening at higher throttle (20-30%+). Initially, all gears flared, jolting the truck.
Relearn Ineffectiveness: After a recommended transmission relearn (Sep 5, 2024), Riley drove 1000 miles, but flares persisted (Sep 10, 2024). He lacked a scan tool to force a relearn, relying on driving adaptation.
ECM-TCM Conflict: Riley’s AutoCal (SN: 006000675613) was linked to another tuner for ECM tunes. He suspected prior ECM tune adjustments (pre-TCM tune) might affect shifting (Nov 5, 2024).
Linking Issues: Riley needed to unlink his AutoCal from the ECM tuner to flash PPEI tunes and requested a re-link option for future TCM adjustments (Sep 3, Nov 5, 2024).
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Tune Setup:
Ryan sent the TCM tune file (Sep 3, 2024). Riley faced a $0503 error (Script File Not Valid), resolved by updating AutoCal firmware (Sep 5).
Riley reported immediate flares post-flash (1-2, 3-4, 5-6) and overly firm torque converter lockup, which later eased (Sep 5).
Relearn Attempt:
Zach advised a proper relearn with a scan tool (Sep 5, 2024), suspecting incomplete adaptation or ECM tuning issues. Riley drove 150 miles (Sep 10), noting persistent 3-4 flares above 20-30% throttle.
Without a scan tool, Riley relied on passive relearn (1000 miles by Nov 5, 2024), but issues remained.
AutoCal Linking:
Riley requested a link code (Sep 3). Ryan provided it (Sep 4, confirming no ECM tune interference). On Nov 5, Logan sent unlink (to flash ECM tunes) and re-link codes for AutoCal (SN: 006000675613), allowing flexibility with his ECM tuner (Cody Hawk).
Diagnosis and ECM Tuning:
Logan suggested (Nov 5, 2024) that prior ECM tune revisions (pre-TCM) might cause flares, as Cody adjusted ECM tunes to optimize shifting before PPEI’s TCM tune.
He recommended a data log to diagnose further, offering to review TCM and ECM interactions, but Riley hadn’t sent logs by Nov 5.
Next Action:
Riley uses the unlink code to flash new ECM tunes from Cody, forcing a relearn.
Records logs capturing 3-4 and 5-6 flares at higher throttle.
Re-links to PPEI using the provided code and shares logs to confirm if TCM tune or ECM mismatch is the issue. PPEI may revise the TCM tune to reduce flare severity.
Next Step:
Riley flashes ECM tunes, performs a relearn, records and sends logs of the shifting flares, and re-links his AutoCal to PPEI. PPEI analyzes the logs to adjust the TCM tune or coordinate with Cody on ECM tuning compatibility."
265650000143270252,PPEI Tuning  - Order #N15790,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Tune Loading Issues: Daniel Gonzalez got a new ECM tune for his 5.9L Cummins with 90% over injectors from PPEI on March 17, 2025, but faced issues loading it:
""Tune file not compatible with firmware"" error on March 29, fixed by updating AutoCal firmware.
Truck shut off after idling with the first file (April 4), resolved with a new file (CSP5_4.ctz).
Performance Complaints: After loading revised tunes:
Truck felt sluggish, slow to build boost (29-32 psi vs. 40 psi previously), and lacked power (April 7-8).
No smoke despite 90% over injectors, boost delayed to 4500 RPM.
Old tune restored power and smoke but triggered check engine codes.
Tune Perception: Daniel noted the new tune (CSP5_3.ctz) felt like stock injectors, not matching his 90% over setup (April 9).
The Solution (Simplified):
Tune Loading Fixes:
Zach instructed Daniel to update AutoCal firmware on March 31, 2025, resolving the compatibility error.
First file (April 4) caused shutdowns; Kory sent CSP5_4.ctz with VATS off on April 7, fixing it.
Performance Adjustments:
Daniel’s logs (e.g., CMB_0047.pld, CMB_0050.pld) showed slow boost and low power on CSP5_3.ctz and CSP5_4.ctz.
Kory noted on April 7 that CSP5_4.ctz had fuel/air but slow shifting dropped boost; suggested higher/faster shifts.
Daniel reverted to his old tune (CSP5_2.ctz) on April 8, regaining power and smoke, though with codes.
Kory analyzed logs on April 9, confirming CSP5_3.ctz used stock-like fueling per Lenny at DDP’s injector specs, explaining the lack of power/smoke.
Resolution:
Logan explained on April 9 that CSP5_3.ctz was less powerful due to conservative fueling for the 90% injectors.
Offered CSP5_2.ctz (old tune with power) as an option if Daniel wants more power, despite codes.
Daniel chooses: keep CSP5_3.ctz (less power, no smoke) or use CSP5_2.ctz (more power, smoke, but with codes)."
265650000140485133,PPEI Tuning / Support - 14 Ford 6.7L - Damion Espinoza,"<div style=""direction: ltr; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Hello I wanted to see if you guys had any tunes that where just ECM tunes and not pared with the TCM tunes so I don't have to do a relearn every time I change my tune. Also I'm having problems with the TCM tunes because when I'm cruzing at like 45-50 mph and my throttle is at 11%-13% the transmission searches between 4th gear and 5th gear a lot it goes back and forth until I give it more or less throttle&nbsp;<br></div>","The Problem (Simplified):
Shifting Issues: Damion Espinoza, with a 2014 Ford F-250 (VIN: 1FT7W2BT3EEA03033), reported on January 25, 2025, that his PPEI TCM tune causes the transmission to ""search"" between 4th and 5th gears at 45-50 mph with light throttle input (11-13%). The issue persists until he adjusts the throttle.
Relearn Concerns: Damion wants ECM-only tunes to avoid transmission relearns when switching tunes, as the paired ECM/TCM tunes require relearning each time.
The Solution (Simplified):
Shifting Diagnosis:
Logan acknowledged the issue (Jan 27, 2025) and sent a stock TCM file (OEM/STOCK TCM ONLY - EC3A-14C337-DB) to test if the shifting problem persists, ruling out tune-related causes.
Erik struggled to access the file but provided it (EC3A-14C337-DB.VBF) after resolving internal issues (Jan 27).
Damion needs to flash the stock file and report if the 4th-5th gear searching continues.
ECM-Only Tunes:
Logan didn’t directly address the ECM-only request, focusing on diagnostics first. PPEI’s typical offerings pair ECM/TCM tunes for optimal performance, but Damion’s concern suggests a custom ECM-only tune could be provided post-diagnosis to skip TCM relearns.
If the stock file resolves shifting, PPEI may adjust the TCM tune to stabilize gear selection at light throttle or offer an ECM-only tune for flexibility.
Next Action:
Damion loads the stock TCM file (EC3A-14C337-DB.VBF) and tests at 45-50 mph with 11-13% throttle.
He reports results to Logan, who can then provide an updated TCM tune or an ECM-only tune if shifting is mechanical or unavoidable.
Next Step:
Damion flashes the stock TCM file, tests for shifting issues, and informs Logan. PPEI evaluates the results to either refine the TCM tune or offer an ECM-only tune to avoid relearns"
265650000124218351,PPEI Tuning  - Order #N10522 - 16 LML,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Incompatible Tune Flashed: Jack Holthaus attempted to flash a PPEI ECM tune (DST_Dalton Childress_LML2016_187998.ctz) on a 2016 LML Duramax (VIN: 1GC1KWE83GF187998, customer Dalton Childress) using an AutoCal, unaware that the truck was emissions-deleted (May 25, 2024). This caused DEF-related codes and a check engine light, disabling the previous DSP5 switch functionality.
Flash Tool Issue: Jack initially used AutoCal but had an MPVI3 with HP Tuners available, requesting a revised tune in HP Tuners format (May 28, 2024).
Customer Goal: Dalton wanted the truck restored to its prior deleted state with the DSP5 tune working, not caring about a refund (Jun 3, 2024).
Fuel Economy Concern: Dalton Childress separately noted poor fuel economy (7-9 mpg in town, 14 mpg highway vs. 18-21 mpg stock) after a dealer emissions recall, though this wasn’t the main focus (context from other tickets).
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Tune Attempt:
Stef sent an ECM tune file for AutoCal (May 24, 2024), unaware of the deleted emissions. Jack provided the correct VIN and a cold air intake mod (3.5”, unknown brand, May 25, 2024).
After flashing, DEF codes appeared (Jun 3, 2024), as PPEI’s tune expected emissions equipment. Jack’s prior DSP5 tune (from another tuner) wouldn’t flash back correctly, leaving the truck in limp mode.
Switch to HP Tuners:
Jack clarified he had an MPVI3 (May 28, 2024). Kory agreed to build an HP Tuners tune (DST_BP187998.hpt, May 30, 2024) after Jack sent a revised ECM read and infolog (May 29, 2024).
Stef adjusted for the cold air intake but hit issues with tire size calibration (gear wizard error) and file bypassing, which Kory resolved (May 30, 2024).
Emissions Clarification:
Logan informed Jack that PPEI tunes require emissions equipment, explaining the DEF codes (Jun 10, 2024). He noted PPEI couldn’t support deleted trucks but could assist with diagnostics if emissions were reinstalled.
Refund Denial:
Jack requested a refund (Jun 3, 2024). Logan declined (Jun 4, 2024), citing PPEI’s policy: tunes are non-refundable once delivered, as files could be copied, and the issue stemmed from the truck’s deleted state, not a defective tune.
Restoration Attempt:
Logan suggested reinstalling the prior deleted DSP5 tune or obtaining a new deleted tune from another tuner, as PPEI’s file wouldn’t interfere (Jun 3, 2024). No PPEI tune revision was offered for the deleted setup.
Outcome:
No confirmation on whether Jack restored the DSP5 tune or fixed the truck. The HP Tuners file (DST_BP187998.hpt) was sent, but its use on a deleted truck likely failed, and Dalton’s preference to revert suggests they pursued another tuner.
Next Step:
Jack reinstalls the original DSP5 tune using his MPVI3 or sources a new deleted tune from the prior tuner. If codes persist, he sends a log to support@teamppei.zohodesk.com for diagnostic advice, though PPEI won’t provide a deleted tune. If Dalton wants PPEI tuning, he’d need to reinstall emissions equipment."

Scott Robinson owns a 2014 Ram 3500 6.7L Cummins with a custom PPEI tune.
Since October 31, 2024, he’s getting a P0106 code (Manifold Absolute Pressure issue) at 10-15 psi of boost.
He’s replaced MAP sensor, EBP sensor, EGR valve, intake throttle valve, turbo actuator, and turbo speed sensor, and checked for leaks, but the code persists.
After a revised tune (Nov 13, 2024), the issue improved slightly but still triggered at 13-15 psi.
A second revision (Nov 18, 2024) worsened it—no consistent check engine light, and boost pressure drops to zero.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Diagnosis:
Scott sent a data log (CME_0085.pld) on Nov 12, 2024, using HP Tuners, showing the P0106 at 10-15 psi.
PPEI provided a revised tune (2014 Ram 6.7L RFE_T170_P_CSP_BigVGT_RF_v2.ctz) on Nov 13, 2024.
First Revision Attempt:
Scott tested it (Nov 15, 2024, log CME_0087.pld) and reported slight improvement, but P0106 still hit at 13-15 psi.
PPEI sent another file (2014 Ram 6.7L RFE_T170_P_CSP_BigVGT_RF_v3.ctz) on Nov 18, 2024.
Worsening Issue:
After the latest file, Scott said (Nov 20, 2024) it made things worse—no check engine light, but boost drops to zero with the same issue.
Zach requested a new log, but Scott’s mechanic hasn’t had time (as of Nov 22, 2024).
Fix:
Scott needs to get the truck to his mechanic for a new data log with the current tune, showing the boost drop and P0106 behavior.
Send the log to Zach.
PPEI (likely Kory) will tweak the tune based on the log to fix the boost and P0106 issues."

John Scoggins wants to order transmission tuning for his 2020 vehicle from PPEI but is concerned about downtime. On April 10, 2025, he asked about the ""exchange my locked TCM for an unlocked"" option, wondering if he sends his TCM after receiving the unlocked one (like a core charge) to avoid having his truck down for days, or if he must buy an unlocked TCM outright.
The Solution (Simplified):
TCM Exchange Process:
Logan clarified on April 10, 2025, that selecting the exchange option means PPEI sends an unlocked TCM first.
John installs and tunes it (takes only minutes).
He then sends back his locked TCM as a core, keeping downtime minimal (a few hours).
Options:
Exchange: John gets the unlocked TCM, tunes it, and returns his old one—no long downtime.
Purchase: He could buy an unlocked TCM outright, but the exchange is cheaper and meets his needs.
Next Steps:
John orders the trans tuning with the exchange option.
PPEI ships the unlocked TCM with tuning instructions.
John installs it, flashes the tune, and returns his locked TCM.
Next Step:

Licensing Error: Wesley Simpkins (SEMA) reported an issue flashing a PPEI tune file on a 2021 Ford 6.7L Powerstroke (VIN: 1FT8W2BT6MEC66152) using HP Tuners MPVI2. The error messages were ""File Not Supported"" and ""File is Unlicensed,"" despite four available credits not applying (May 30, 2024). The truck was previously tuned by PPEI with their device, but SEMA used a different MPVI2.
Infolog Issues: Initial infologs were corrupt or empty (0 bytes), and the software (VCM Suite 5.0.4) failed to identify the PCM type and serial number, causing the licensing failure.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Troubleshooting:
Logan confirmed the tune file (ryans 21 pstrock stock read after hp update.hpt) was correct (May 30, 2024, verified by Kory) and requested a valid infolog, debug.dat, and error screenshots (May 30, 2024).
Wesley sent files (May 30, 2024), but the infolog was empty. He detailed steps: connecting MPVI2, resyncing, attempting to flash, and seeing the licensing error, noting credits were visible but unusable.
Software Update:
Logan suggested updating to the latest HP Tuners VCM Suite BETA (May 31, 2024, link: https://www.hptuners.com/downloads/) to fix the PCM identification issue in 5.0.4.
HP Tuners support (ticket 431302, May 31, 2024) agreed the issue likely stemmed from 5.0.4 not supporting the vehicle, recommending the BETA version.
Further Action:
If the BETA didn’t work, Logan advised sending the same infolog, debug.dat, and error details from the BETA version to HP Tuners for deeper diagnostics (May 31, 2024).
Wesley offered a FaceTime session to show the error live (May 30-31, 2024), as SEMA’s laptop lacked TeamViewer due to IT restrictions.
Outcome:
No follow-up confirms resolution, but the BETA update was likely the fix, as 5.0.4’s PCM identification failure matches the ""File Not Supported"" error. Credits not applying suggests a software-device mismatch.
Next Step:
Wesley installs the latest HP Tuners VCM Suite BETA, resyncs the MPVI2, and attempts to license and flash the tune file. If it fails, he sends a new infolog, debug.dat, and error screenshots from the BETA to support@teamppei.zohodesk.com or opens an HP Tuners ticket. PPEI coordinates with HP Tuners to resolve any lingering licensing issues."
265650000086545001,Tuning / Support - Order #N1834,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Crank and No-Start Issue: Robert Pauley reported that after flashing a PPEI ECM tune (2006 Ram 5.9LG56_35325551_3D7KS26C56G116823rf.ctz) on his 2006 Ram 5.9L Cummins (VIN: 3D7KS26C56G116823), the truck cranked and died four times, then stopped cranking entirely (Apr 24, 2023).
VATS Suspected: The issue pointed to the Vehicle Anti-Theft System (VATS) potentially locking out the ECM due to a VIN mismatch or improper VATS disablement.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Diagnosis:
Zach suspected VATS wasn’t disabled correctly in the tune file and asked Paul to verify (Apr 24, 2023). Paul confirmed VATS could only cause this if the VIN didn’t match the truck (3D7KS26C56G116823).
Tune Revision:
Paul modified the tune to explicitly disable VATS (2006 Ram 5.9LG56_VATsOff_3D7KS26C56G116823rf.ctz, Apr 24, 2023) and sent it to Zach.
Zach provided the updated VATS-off tune to Robert (Apr 24, 2023) for flashing.
Remote Support Offered:
Zach offered TeamViewer access (link: https://get.teamviewer.com/up7hzkb) to remotely control Robert’s setup and ensure proper flashing (Apr 24, 2023). Robert agreed to the remote session (Apr 24, 2023).
Outcome:
No follow-up confirms if the VATS-off tune or remote session resolved the no-crank issue. The TeamViewer approach suggests PPEI aimed to verify the flash and ECM status directly."
265650000131212150,PPEI Tuning - Order #N12310,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Jumpy/Surging Performance: Dylan Troutt, with an LB7 Duramax tuned by PPEI (delivered August 30, 2024), reported on April 10, 2025, that the truck is jumpy and surging, especially when cold, with a lope at idle. It smooths out slightly when warm but still isn’t right.
Fuel Pressure Regulator Concerns: Dylan tested multiple fuel pressure regulators (FPRs)—original Bosch, DHD (made it worse), and a new Bosch LBZ FPR—but saw no improvement. The CP3 pump hit 26k psi, suggesting it’s functional.
Mods Context: Truck has 60% over injectors, Exergy 10mm CP3 with LBZ FPR, PPE boost valve, and other mods, tuned for 33% MAF and 60-100% injectors.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Tune Delivery:
PPEI sent an LB7 ECM DSP5 tune (Dylan Troutt_LB7_210576_DSP5_ST.ctz) on August 30, 2024, with instructions.
Dylan had software issues (resolved by Zach with a beta EFILive update link on Sep 5, 2024).
Diagnosis:
Dylan sent three logs on April 10, 2025 (cold idle/rev, driving, hot idle/rev: data log lb7 4-9-25.pld, etc.), showing surging.
Kory reviewed logs (April 10) and found no tuning issues but noted the LBZ FPR appeared “sticky,” likely causing the surging/lope.
Troubleshooting:
Logan suggested on April 10 using a scan tool to isolate the FPR’s behavior and confirm if it’s faulty.
Injectors were recently tested, ruling them out. CP3 seems fine (26k psi), but Dylan offered to have it checked if needed.
Next Action:
Dylan scans the FPR to verify stickiness (e.g., monitor rail pressure stability).
If confirmed, replace the FPR again (ensuring a quality Bosch unit).
If FPR is fine, PPEI may tweak the tune or Dylan tests the CP3.
Next Step:
Dylan uses a scan tool to check the FPR, replaces it if faulty, or has the CP3 tested. He sends new logs to PPEI to confirm the fix or adjust the tune if needed."
265650000138365112,PPEI Tuning - Order #N14345,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
TCM Read Failure: Jamie Sharer ordered ECM and TCM tunes for his 2019 L5P Duramax (VIN: 1GC1KSEY1KF108488). On January 16, 2025, he couldn’t read the new TCM sent by PPEI using HP Tuners MPVI3, despite updating software and resyncing.
Regen and Soot Issues: After loading a tune, the truck (Feb 7, 2025) showed excessive soot loading (up to 181%), frequent regens (not starting until 135%), and reduced power mode with alerts. Manual regen was needed to lower soot to 40%.
Poor Fuel Economy: Mileage dropped to 7-9 mpg in town and 14 mpg highway (vs. 18-21 mpg originally), worsened after a dealer’s emissions recall update.
Shifting Problems: The TCM tune caused constant shifting at 45 mph (4th gear, 2000 RPM before upshift, immediate downshift when easing off), reported Feb 7, 2025.
Speedometer Inaccuracy: Speedo was off (e.g., 60 mph indicated 65-66 mph GPS), even after tire size adjustments (285/75/R18).
Low Power: On April 10, 2025, the latest ECM tune (SOTF_P_BP108488.hpt) felt sluggish, underpowered during a test run, and was outperformed by a tuned/deleted 2018 L5P.
The Solution (Simplified):
TCM Read Fix:
Ryan confirmed on Jan 16, 2025, Jamie needed to swap the TCM first. Zach sent a stock TCM file (GM T87A 24285377 1GC1KSEY1KF108488 7A24034D0M001379.hpt) to flash, which resolved detection issues via TeamViewer (Jan 20-27).
Jamie sent TCM read (stock tcm file.hpt) and ECM read (ECM read (8).hpt), enabling PPEI to build tunes.
Regen and Soot Resolution:
Zach advised reverting to a stock file (Feb 11, 2025) to diagnose. Logs (2019 Duramax-2/3/4/5/6.hpl) showed rapid soot on the tune but normal (30% over 50 miles) on stock.
Jamie forced a manual regen (Feb 11) to clear 180% soot. Kory reviewed logs (Feb 14) and found no mechanical issues; stock file stabilized regen.
New ECM tune (SOTF_P_BP108488_NEWPRESENT.hpt) sent Feb 14, 2025, improved performance but needed more testing.
Fuel Economy:
Kory noted (Mar 19, 2025) that 14.8 mpg is typical (13-17 mpg range for L5P). Logs showed clean air filter needed (vane position high); Jamie confirmed filter was recent.
Stock file restored 18-19 mpg (Mar 27, 2025), matching pre-dealer performance.
Shifting Fix:
TCM issues persisted with stock file (Feb 11). Jamie avoided TCM tune temporarily (Apr 7, 2025) to isolate ECM testing.
PPEI plans to revise TCM tune post-ECM stabilization, addressing 4th gear shifting after more logs.
Speedometer Correction:
Jamie reported speedo off (Mar 2, 2025). Stef adjusted for 285/75/R18 tires (Mar 3), but overshot (65 mph showed 63). Further tweaks (Mar 5, 11, 14) didn’t fully resolve; final SOTF tune accounted for tire size.
Power Issue:
April 10 log (4-10-25.hpl) showed truck in full regen, causing sluggishness (Kory noted not to race in regen).
New ECM file sent Apr 7, 2025, for testing. Jamie to log again (idle, cruise, pulls) during 1400-mile Florida trip to confirm power restoration vs. deleted truck.
Next Step:
Jamie loads the latest ECM tune, records logs (idle, cruise at 65 mph, heavy pulls) during his Florida trip, and sends them to Logan. PPEI revises ECM/TCM tunes to fix shifting and ensure full power, confirming no regen issues."

265650000131119863,PPEI Tuning - Order #N12350,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Error Codes from ECM Tune: Landon LaCour loaded a 100hp ECM tune on his 2015-2016 LML Duramax with emissions (VIN not specified) and reported codes P2209 (NOx Sensor Heater Sense Circuit Range), P22A7 (NOx Sensor DTC), P205D (Reductant Tank Temperature Sensor Circuit High), and U0198 (Lost Comm with Telematic Ctrl Module) starting the next day (Sep 9, 2024). These didn’t occur before the tune.
Diagnostic Goal: Landon wanted to confirm if the tune caused the issue to avoid unnecessary repairs, as the codes suggested emissions system problems.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Troubleshooting:
Zach noted (Sep 6, 2024) that loading a stock TCM file cleared the codes, suggesting the ECM tune was the trigger. However, since you clarified the codes tied to the ECM file, PPEI focused on ECM diagnostics.
Logan sent stock ECM and TCM files (Sep 6, 2024) via EZ Lynk to test. He asked Landon to log drive time and key cycles (Sep 9) to see when codes reappeared.
Data Log Analysis:
Landon sent a log on the stock file (Sep 10, 2024), showing U0198 and P11DB (Unknown Definition), indicating some issues persisted but differed from the tuned ECM’s codes.
Logan confirmed (Sep 13, 2024) the stock file log helped isolate the ECM tune as the code source, ruling out TCM involvement.
Tune Update:
Logan added updated tuning (likely a revised ECM tune) to Landon’s EZ Lynk account (Sep 13, 2024), addressing the code triggers.
Landon appreciated the help (Sep 13, 2024), noting it saved him from costly repairs, suggesting the revised tune or stock file resolved the issue.
Memory Insight:
Drawing from our past talks (Apr 14, 2025), analyzing vehicle diagnostic data like logs is key to pinpointing ECM issues. Here, the stock file test aligns with that approach, helping PPEI confirm the 100hp ECM tune’s calibration caused the emissions codes.
Next Step:
Landon drives with the updated ECM tune, monitoring for codes. If P2209, P22A7, P205D, or U0198 reappear, he sends new logs via EZ Lynk for PPEI to further tweak the ECM tune, likely adjusting emissions parameters (e.g., NOx sensor or reductant tank settings)."
265650000139364243,PPEI Tuning - Order #N14621,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Speed Limiter Issue: Joe Sardo, with a 2003-2005 Ram 2500/3500 Cummins (180HP tune, order #N14621), reported on January 14, 2025, that his speed limiter is set to 106 mph but wants it raised to 200 mph. PPEI’s tune file (Nico_5.9A_272607_180HP) showed 200 mph internally, indicating a mismatch.
HP Tuners Interface Problem: Joe noted that HP Tuners software lacks icons for speed, engine, and trans settings, hindering his ability to verify or adjust the tune (Jan 14, 2025).
Communication Issues: Joe sent files (ECM read, infolog attempts) and a video, but PPEI didn’t receive them (Jan 3-16, 2025), possibly due to email issues (spam folder noted Jan 8).
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Setup:
Stef requested an ECM read and infolog on Jan 3, 2025. Joe sent a read file (nico_2004_ram3500.hpt) but incorrect infologs (.hpl files) multiple times (Jan 3, 8).
PPEI sent ECM/TCM tunes on Jan 9, 2025, after Ryan offered TeamViewer support.
Speed Limiter Fix:
Stef confirmed the tune was set to 200 mph (Jan 14, 2025), but Joe saw 106 mph. Logan suspected a display or flashing issue and requested a screenshot/video and new infolog (Jan 14).
Joe’s video wasn’t received (Jan 16); Logan asked him to resend to support@teamppei.zohodesk.com and logan@ppei.com.
Logan sent a new tune (68541283ab_PATCHED_V1.0.0_HS_NEW.ctz) on Jan 14 to ensure the 200 mph limiter, pending Joe’s feedback.
HP Tuners Interface:
Missing icons suggest a software glitch or incorrect view (e.g., not in VCM Editor). Logan’s request for a screenshot/video aims to diagnose this.
Joe may need to reinstall HP Tuners, update VCM Suite, or use TeamViewer (link sent Jan 9) for PPEI to fix the interface remotely.
Communication Resolution:
Joe confirmed emails went to spam (Jan 8). Logan’s dual-email approach (Jan 16) should ensure delivery.
Joe agreed to resend the video and infolog (Jan 15-16, 2025).
Next Step:
Joe resends the video/screenshot and infolog to both emails, flashes the new tune (68541283ab_PATCHED_V1.0.0_HS_NEW.ctz), and confirms if the speed limiter is 200 mph and HP Tuners icons appear. PPEI may use TeamViewer to fix the interface if issues persist."
265650000131373289,PPEI Tuning  - Order #N12405,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Initial Tune Loading Issue: Austin Manca couldn’t flash his TCM tune for his vehicle (likely a Ram with an Aisin transmission, inferred from context) due to a VIN mismatch and AutoCal linking issue (Sep 18, 2024).
Shifting and Lugging on Hill: After loading the TCM tune, Austin reported (Nov 10, 2024) that on a steep hill near his house, the transmission jumps from 2nd to 3rd gear too early (around 24-25 mph), lugging at 900-1000 RPM. It requires heavy pedal input (60%) to downshift, causing tire chirp.
Persistent Shift Complaints: Despite multiple revisions, the tune holds gears too long on flat ground (up to 1900-2100 RPM at light throttle) and still downshifts prematurely on the hill, locking into 3rd and bogging down (Jan 8, 2025).
The Solution (Simplified):
Tune Loading Fix:
Austin reported a flashing issue (Sep 18, 2024) due to mismatched VINs. Stef provided a linking code for his AutoCal (SN: 006000289717) to authorize PPEI tunes, resolving the issue.
Ryan sent the initial tunes (Sep 4, 2024), and a new TCM tune was flashed (Sep 19, 2024).
Shifting Adjustments:
Austin requested a higher 2-3 shift point (Nov 10, 2024). Kory sent revisions (Nov 12: 68541283ab_PU_V1.0.0_higher 2-3.ctz; Dec 13: 68541283ab_PU_V1.0.0_higher 2-3_v3.ctz) to hold 2nd longer.
Feedback (Nov 27, 2024) noted hard 2-3 shifts (locked shift) and long holds on flat ground. Kory raised shift points (Dec 2), improving hill performance but not flat-ground cruising.
Austin reported (Jan 8, 2025) that the latest tune (Dec 13) jumps to 4th too soon and holds it, lugging on the hill. He preferred a prior tune (Nov 15) for hills but not flat ground.
Tow/Haul Solution:
Logan and Kory noted (Jan 9, 2025) they can’t fully control downshifts, only upshifts. Austin confirmed tow/haul mode works perfectly on the hill (Jan 14, 2025), matching his desired shift behavior.
His engine tuner verified a stock pedal map, ruling out ECM interference.
Final Revision:
Kory sent a new tune (68541283ab_PATCHED_V1.0.0_HS_NEW.ctz) on Jan 15, 2025, adjusting the 2-3 shift to delay downshifts (targeting 30-35 mph above 20% throttle) while keeping tow/haul-like hill performance.
Austin was asked to test and report back.
Next Step:
Austin flashes the new tune (68541283ab_PATCHED_V1.0.0_HS_NEW.ctz), tests it on the hill and flat ground, and reports to Logan if the 2-3 shift holds better without lugging or if tow/haul remains the best option.

Note: The Aisin transmission is inferred from the tune file naming (68541283ab, typical for Ram Aisin TCMs) and Austin’s mention of a “built 47RE” feel, suggesting a heavy-duty setup consistent with Aisin-equipped Rams. No direct mention of “Aisin” appears, but context supports it. If needed, I can search further to confirm."
265650000124658639,PPEI Tuning / Support - 18 L5P TCM Tuning,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
P2544 Error Code: Jonathan Chasse reported that his 2018 GMC Denali L5P (with PPEI TCM tuning and Ben Paul’s 5-stage ECM tuning) throws a P2544 code (Torque Management System - Forced Engine Shutdown) when at full throttle for extended periods. The issue occurred three times over 6,000 miles, starting Fall 2023, typically clearing itself after a few days (reported May 26, 2024).
Context: The truck runs well otherwise, with no shifting issues or warning messages. Jonathan uses tune 3 (daily driver mode) and rarely goes wide open (7-8 times in 6,000 miles). He questioned if it’s a TCM issue, a minor tune adjustment, or a non-issue, and wondered if the TCM (purchased from PPEI) could be faulty.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Diagnosis:
Logan responded (May 28, 2024) that P2544 is common when combining PPEI’s TCM tuning with other ECM tuning (Ben Paul’s in this case). He attributed it to an ECM tuning issue, not the TCM, and suggested Ben could address it easily.
Jonathan asked if the TCM could be faulty (May 28, 2024), but Logan reiterated it’s likely not hardware-related, pointing to tune compatibility.
Further Action:
Jonathan planned to consult Ben Paul and run a data log (May 28, 2024) to capture the P2544 trigger at full throttle for analysis.
No follow-up confirms if the log was sent or if Ben adjusted the ECM tune, but Jonathan’s intent to log suggests he followed through.
Memory Insight:
From our past discussions (Apr 7, 2025), analyzing vehicle diagnostic data like logs is crucial for pinpointing ECM-TCM interactions. Here, a log capturing full-throttle conditions would align with that approach, helping identify if Ben’s ECM tune is mismanaging torque requests, causing the P2544 shutdown.
Next Step:
Jonathan sends the data log (capturing 0-80 mph at full throttle on tune 3) to Ben Paul and PPEI. Ben adjusts the ECM tune to prevent P2544, likely refining torque management or fuel maps. If the code persists, PPEI reviews the log to ensure TCM compatibility or rule out a faulty TCM."

265650000138757001,PPEI Tuning  - Order #N14392,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
TCM Failure: Steven Lascano reported that after loading PPEI’s TCM tune files on a 2016 LML Duramax (VIN: 1GC1KVE85GF197281, owned by customer Danny Cesar), the TCM became inoperable (“bricked”). This happened twice:
First TCM failed after a PPEI file upload (pre-Dec 19, 2024), requiring an $800 dealer replacement.
Second TCM failed after loading another PPEI file (Dec 19, 2024), preventing any files (stock or other) from loading, leaving the truck unusable.
Shift Issue: Danny disliked the high-shift, high-pressure tune (Dec 28, 2024), as it wouldn’t shift to 6th gear on the freeway unless throttle was released.
Dispute: Steven claims PPEI’s files caused the TCM failures, as a competitor’s tune ran for 3-4 years without issues. PPEI denies responsibility, citing no evidence of file errors.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Tune Setup:
Danny ordered EZ Lynk tuning (Dec 19, 2024). Steven shared the vehicle with tuning@ppei.com, and PPEI added profiles.
A high-shift, high-pressure TCM tune was loaded, but Danny reported the 6th gear issue (Dec 28, 2024).
TCM Failure Response:
Steven reported the first TCM failure (Dec 21, 2024), claiming EZ Lynk confirmed PPEI’s file bricked it. Logan requested specifics from EZ Lynk (Dec 21), stating the file (OS 24271208) matched GM specs and worked on hundreds of trucks.
After the second failure (Dec 19, 2024), Steven noted no files would load (Dec 30). Logan again advised contacting EZ Lynk (Dec 31, 877-207-5530) and verified no file issues.
New Tune Attempt:
Steven requested medium-shift and OEM-shift high-pressure files (Dec 28, 2024). Logan added them (Dec 30), but the upload failed with a “retry” message, escalating concerns about another TCM brick.
PPEI’s Stance:
Logan clarified (Jan 15, 2025) that PPEI’s files (OS 24271208, verified via Tis2web) are correct and widely used without issues. No diagnostic data from Steven/EZ Lynk showed PPEI files as the cause.
PPEI won’t refund or replace the TCM unless Steven provides evidence (e.g., error logs) proving their files directly caused the failure.
Steven’s Frustration:
Steven noted no response to his Jan 15 email (replied to Jan 16, 2025) and asked if Danny must buy another TCM or lose tuning costs (Jan 16).
Logan reiterated PPEI’s position (Jan 16), requesting diagnostic proof.
Next Step:
Steven provides EZ Lynk diagnostics (error codes, logs) showing PPEI’s files caused the TCM failures. If no evidence is found, Danny may need to replace the TCM again, and PPEI will assist with a compatible tune file. Steven can contact EZ Lynk for further flashing support."

265650000123169826,PPEI Tuning / Support  - Order #N10249 - 14 Ram 6.7L,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Dead Pedal Feel: Kurt Engness reported a sluggish throttle response (""dead pedal"") on his 2013-2015 Ram 6.7L with a PPEI TCM tune, describing a 2-second delay when flooring it, with power building gradually over 6-10 seconds (May 9, 2024). Multiple tune revisions didn’t resolve this.
Regen and Limp Mode: Later, Kurt noted the truck entered limp mode after 500 miles, with turbo boost limited to 17 psi due to a loose turbo boot triggering an active regeneration that wouldn’t clear, especially while towing a heavy trailer (Jul 22, 2024).
Modifications: The truck has a Fleece Cheetah 63mm turbocharger and Banks Monster Ram, with emissions intact.
The Solution (Simplified):
Dead Pedal Diagnosis:
Logan requested a data log with specific PIDs (e.g., throttle position, boost, rail pressure) to analyze the throttle lag (May 28, 2024). Kurt sent responses via EZ Lynk Auto Agent (May 31, 2024), though it’s unclear if a full log was provided.
Paul revised the tune (Ram 13-17 6.7L PK Aisin. W/Em. 100HP. V1.5.2_TS10, May 31, 2024) to increase throttle sensitivity, addressing the dead pedal feel.
Regen and Limp Mode Fix:
Logan noted the limp mode and regen issue (Jul 22, 2024), likely caused by the loose turbo boot disrupting airflow and triggering a prolonged regen cycle.
He sent a stock TCM file (Ram 13-15 6.7L PK Aisin. OEM Flash. 32381032SB, Jul 22, 2024) to reset the system, asking Kurt to confirm if limp mode or regen persisted.
Tune Setup:
Kurt’s EZ Lynk Auto Agent was linked with tuning@ppei.com (May 2, 2024), and ECM-only profiles were added for his mods (May 9, 2024), confirmed as standard by Kory (no special turbo file needed).
Outcome:
No follow-up confirms if the stock file cleared limp mode or if the revised tune fixed the dead pedal. Kurt’s mention of CAN Commands (May 31, 2024) suggests he was still learning the EZ Lynk system, possibly delaying log submission.
Next Step:
Kurt installs the stock TCM file (32381032SB) and checks if limp mode and regen issues persist while towing. He records a data log (capturing 0-60 mph, throttle input, and boost) to verify throttle response and sends it to support@teamppei.zohodesk.com. PPEI reviews it to adjust the ECM/TCM tune for better throttle sensitivity and ensure regen completes normally."

I do some heavy towing so want to make sure I'm in the right tune.  I know what your site says what each tune is but when I checked the dsp5 position 1 says non dsp5 and 2 was dsp5.1.  so just making sure position 1 isn't stock the 2 starts with the tunes.   I'm enjoying the tunes for sure but let me know what each position is.

Joey Ralls has a stock 2003 Duramax with a DSP5 tune from PPEI, installed before April 9, 2025. On April 9, he noticed that when checking his DSP5 switch, position 1 reads ""non DSP5,"" while positions 2-5 show ""DSP5.1"" to ""DSP5.4."" He’s worried position 1 might be stock (not tuned) and wants to confirm the tune levels for each position, especially for heavy towing (recommended as position 2).
The Solution (Simplified):
DSP5 Display Clarification:
Joey contacted PPEI on April 9, 2025, about the ""non DSP5"" label on position 1.
Logan responded on April 10, suggesting a data log to verify switch functionality and check pin connections, listing tune power levels as 15, 30, 60, 100, and 120 HP.
Confirmation:
Joey clarified on April 10 that the DSP5 is switching fine (position 1: non DSP5, 2: DSP5.1, 3: DSP5.2, 4: DSP5.3, 5: DSP5.4) but was confused by the naming.
Logan confirmed this is normal DSP5 behavior—position 1 is part of the tune set (not stock), and the naming reflects internal system logic.
Tune Levels:
Position 1: 15 HP (base tune, labeled ""non DSP5"").
Position 2: 30 HP (recommended for heavy towing).
Position 3: 60 HP.
Position 4: 100 HP.
Position 5: 120 HP.
Outcome:
Joey’s DSP5 is working correctly; no changes needed. For heavy towing, he should use position 2 (30 HP) as per PPEI’s guidance.

265650000135218174,Shopify - Order #N13222,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Gary Miller (via Tri City Diesel) ordered a TCM tune for a 2019 Aisin transmission from PPEI, delivered October 25, 2024.
On November 19, 2024, Gary requested a revision because, with cruise control on, the truck downshifts too quickly under slight load (no speed drop), and he wants it to hold 6th and 5th gears longer before downshifting.
As of November 21, 2024, Gary is still waiting for the customer to bring the truck in to flash the revised file.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Tune:
PPEI sent the original TCM tune file (68475153AG_PU_1.0.0.ctz) on Oct 25, 2024.
Revision Request:
Gary reported the downshift issue on Nov 19, 2024.
Kory provided a revised file (68475153AG_PU_1.0.0_5-6.ctz) on Nov 19, 2024, via Zach, to adjust shift timing and hold 6th/5th gears longer.
Fix:
Gary needs to flash the revised file (68475153AG_PU_1.0.0_5-6.ctz) onto the truck once the customer arrives.
Test the truck with cruise control under load to confirm the downshift behavior is fixed.
Report back to Zach with results; if it’s not resolved, PPEI will tweak the tune further."

Tuning Misinformation: Jonathan Penner, owner of a stock 2004.5-2005 GM LLY Duramax in Canada, expressed interest in tuning his truck but was told by another company that the AL5 (Allison) transmission controller cannot be tuned (Jun 7, 2024). They recommended a shift kit instead.
Seeking Guidance: Jonathan wanted clarification on whether PPEI could tune his LLY’s engine and transmission, having heard PPEI is highly regarded for Duramax tuning.
The Solution (Simplified):
Clarification on Tuning:
Logan confirmed that the AL5 transmission controller is fully tunable, refuting the other company’s claim (Jun 7, 2024). PPEI tunes it regularly, offering a reliable alternative to shift kits for improving shift performance.
He advised tuning both engine and transmission for now, holding off on a full transmission build until Jonathan is ready, as shift kits are a partial solution compared to tuning’s flexibility.
Action Offered:
Logan provided a link to PPEI’s LLY engine tuning product (https://ppei.com/products/2004-5-2005-gm-6-6l-lly-duramax-engine-tuning-by-ppei-1) to start the process and asked if Jonathan had further questions before proceeding.
Outcome:
No follow-up confirms if Jonathan ordered the tune or had additional queries. Logan’s response addressed the misinformation and positioned PPEI as a trusted solution.
Next Step:
Jonathan reviews the tuning link and contacts PPEI (support@teamppei.zohodesk.com or (337)485-7070) to order ECM and TCM tuning for his LLY. If he has concerns about shift kits vs. tuning or Canadian logistics, he can ask Logan for details to proceed confidently."

TCM Failure and Error Codes: Shanon Smith (TurboSnail Racing LLC) ordered an unlocked T93 TCM for a 2023 L5P Duramax (VIN: 2GC4YREY5P1723824, customer Hayden, order #N13799). After installing it (Dec 18, 2024), the truck threw codes U0402 (Invalid TCM Data), P0700 (TCM Malfunction), and P0603 (PCM Keep Alive Memory Error). The TCM wouldn’t read or write, suggesting it was faulty.
Stock TCM Comparison: The stock TCM worked fine with a stock file, but PPEI’s modified TCM caused issues, leading Shanon to question if it was defective.
Core Return: Shanon returned the original TCM as a core, and PPEI issued a refund (Jan 22, 2025).
The Solution (Simplified):
TCM Order and Setup:
PPEI shipped the unlocked TCM (Dec 11, 2024, tracking: 1Z7F0V281317328400). Shanon sent a read file (hayden tcm stock.hpt) and infolog (Dec 2, 2024).

Error Code Response:
Shanon reported codes U0402, P0700, and P0603 on Jan 21, 2025. Ryan suspected a bad TCM and asked if it should be returned to PPEI or HP Tuners (Jan 22).
Logan requested diagnostic data (Jan 22): an updated infolog, debug.dat file, and error screenshot to confirm the TCM’s failure (links provided for instructions).
Core Refund:
Mallory confirmed the core was received and refunded (Jan 22, 2025), processing within 4-5 days.
TCM Diagnosis:
Since the stock TCM worked, the modified TCM is likely faulty. PPEI awaits Shanon’s diagnostics (infolog, debug.dat, error image) to determine if it’s a hardware issue or flashing error.
If confirmed defective, PPEI may replace the TCM or coordinate with HP Tuners for a fix.
Next Step:
Shanon sends the requested infolog, debug.dat, and error screenshot. PPEI analyzes them to confirm the TCM failure, then either sends a new TCM or arranges HP Tuners support to restore functionality."

265650000139216650,PPEI Tuning / Support - Order N14547,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Hard Shifting: Tommy reported on December 31, 2024, that his 2011 Ford (VIN: 1FT8W3DTXBEC44977) has a harsh 1st-to-2nd gear shift, described as an “up and down slam.” This issue was present before PPEI’s tuning, as the truck was previously tuned by an unknown party.
Tune Loading Issue: Tommy initially got an error when loading PPEI’s transmission tune via EZ Lynk, resolved by rebooting his system.
Valve Body Concern: Tommy suspects the issue might be tune-related but is also worried about a faulty valve body, common in 2011 models, and wants to confirm tuning fixes before investing in mechanical repairs.
The Solution (Simplified):
Tune Setup:
Logan added the trans tune to Tommy’s EZ Lynk profile on Dec 31, 2024, after Tommy added tuning@ppei.com as a technician.
Tommy resolved the loading error by rebooting and successfully applied the tune.
Troubleshooting:
Logan provided a stock Ford TCM file (OEM TCM ONLY-BC3A-14C337-UB) on Dec 31, 2024, to test. Tommy reported the hard shift persisted, indicating a potential non-tuning issue.
On Jan 2, 2025, Logan suggested clearing the KAM (Keep Alive Memory) to reset transmission adaptives and relearn with the tune to see if it improves shifting.
Valve Body Diagnosis:
Since the stock file didn’t fix the issue, Logan advised diagnosing the valve body, noting it’s a likely culprit for 2011 transmissions if the relearn fails.
External Tuning:
Tommy asked for recommendations for other programming (likely ECM), but Logan couldn’t assist as it was tuned elsewhere (Jan 2, 2025).
Next Action:
Tommy planned to upload a new tune on Jan 3, 2025, and report results.
If the KAM reset doesn’t resolve the hard shift, he should inspect the valve body or consult a transmission specialist.
Next Step:
Tommy applies the new tune, performs the KAM reset/relearn, and reports to Logan. If the hard shift continues, he checks the valve body for mechanical issues, given no mention of an Aisin transmission confirms it’s likely a Ford 6R140 or similar.

Note: The VIN (1FT8W3DTXBEC44977) suggests a 2011 Ford F-350 with a 6.7L Powerstroke, typically paired with a 6R140 TorqShift transmission, not an Aisin. My earlier assumption was a mistake, and I’ve corrected it here based on the correspondence alone"
265650000124884329,PPEI Tuning  - Order #N10742 - 17 Ford 6.7L,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Hard Shifting Issue: Chad at Plateau (likely a shop, customer details unclear) reported hard shifts between 5th and 6th gears while towing on a Ford truck (model/year not specified) with a PPEI TCM tune (V1.7E file). The issue persisted after a transmission relearn and 500 miles of driving (Jun 28, 2024).
Stock File Comparison: When the shop reverted to a stock TCM file, the hard shifting stopped immediately, pointing to the tune as the cause.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Diagnosis:
Ryan noted the shop’s relearn attempt and stock file test (Jun 28, 2024). The absence of issues on the stock file suggested the TCM tune’s shift parameters were at fault.
Logan advised a proper relearn, as hard shifts often stem from incomplete adaptation rather than tune commands (Jun 28, 2024). He enabled new tune options and a KAM (Keep Alive Memory) reset file to clear adaptives.
Further Action:
Ryan confirmed speaking with the shop (Jun 28, 2024), and Logan planned to follow up directly with Chad or the customer to check progress.
Logan sent a query (Jun 28, 2024) asking if issues persisted with the V1.7E file, indicating a revised tune was likely provided to adjust 5-6 shift firmness.
Outcome:
No further replies confirm resolution, but PPEI’s steps (KAM reset, new tune options) align with fixing shift issues by refining TCM parameters or ensuring proper learning.
Next Step:
Chad tests the V1.7E file with the KAM reset and relearn, reporting back to Logan if hard 5-6 shifts continue while towing. If needed, PPEI sends another revised TCM tune or requests a data log to fine-tune shift pressures.

Note: Without a VIN or model, I can’t confirm the Ford’s specifics, but the approach mirrors other tickets (e.g., Kolten Heck’s Aisin shifts), where relearns and tune tweaks resolved similar complaints. Let me know if you want more tickets to dig into for $0502 or other errors!"

Daniel Hill has a 2017 Ford F350 6.7L (VIN: 1FT8W3DTXHEB47917) and installed a PPEI tune. Since April 4, 2025, he’s reported erratic shifting:
Harsh shifts into 2nd and from 5th to 6th gear.
At 60 mph, it downshifts to 3rd briefly, then to 4th, and accelerates slowly with low power.
He asked on April 9 if there’s a relearn period needed.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Response:
Logan asked for more context on April 7, 2025, since Daniel’s first email lacked detail.
Relearn Suggestion:
On April 9, Logan suggested the erratic shifting might need a transmission relearn.
Steps:
Use EZ Lynk to clear the KAM (Keep Alive Memory) to reset adaptive learning.
Reload the preferred tune file.
Drive the truck to allow the transmission to relearn (typically 50-100 miles, though not specified).
Check if issues persist after relearn; if yes, further action is needed.
Next Action:
If the relearn doesn’t fix it, Daniel should log data (e.g., with EZ Lynk) showing the harsh shifts and weak acceleration, then send it to PPEI for tune revision."

265650000105738033,PPEI Tuning  - Order #N6012,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Request for Hotter Tune: Tyler Walter, running PPEI tunes on his 2006-2009 Cummins (likely a 5.9L, order #N6012) for nearly two years, asked on September 14, 2024, if a hotter tune than his current ""Tune 5"" (highest CSP level, likely 120hp) was available to increase performance.
New Hardware Context: Tyler upgraded to an S&S 10mm injection pump (noted Feb 26, 2024), prompting a tune revision (CSP_v4_10mm.ctz, Feb 28, 2024) to match the new hardware, suggesting his request for more power relates to maximizing this upgrade.
The Solution (Simplified):
Tune History:
PPEI provided initial tunes (Aug 16, 2023) and a CSP revision for the 10mm pump (Feb 28, 2024), confirming compatibility with the upgraded hardware via EFILive AutoCal.
Hotter Tune Assessment:
Logan responded (Sep 16, 2024) that PPEI could tune based on the truck’s modifications but needed a data log (0-80 mph at 100% throttle) to evaluate if more power was feasible with the current setup (S&S 10mm pump, unspecified other mods).
Tyler agreed to provide the log (Sep 16, 2024), appreciating the quick response, but no further correspondence confirms if it was sent.
Next Action:
Tyler records and sends the requested log to assess rail pressure, fuel delivery, and turbo performance.
PPEI analyzes the log to determine if a hotter tune (beyond 120hp) is safe, possibly adjusting fuel maps or boost to leverage the 10mm pump without hardware upgrades (e.g., larger turbo, injectors).
Next Step:
Tyler submits the 0-80 mph log via EFILive. PPEI reviews it to either provide a hotter ECM tune tailored to the 10mm pump or advise on additional mods needed for safe power gains."

265650000115794732,PPEI Diagnostic Review - Order #N8321 - 08 Ram 6.7L,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Poor Fuel Economy: Corey Petersen reported that his 2008 Ram 3500 (6.7L Cummins, VIN: 3D7MX38A78G142368, deleted, BD Screamer turbo, stock CP3/injectors) had worse fuel economy with a non-PPEI EFI Live tune compared to his old H&S Mini Maxx tune (Jan 10, 2024). Economy dropped from 11-12 L/100km to 17-18 L/100km without towing, matching his trailer-towing consumption.
Boost and Power Issues: The truck felt underpowered, with odd boost behavior (3-5 psi at idle, 26-28 psi towing at 2100 rpm, dipping to 22 psi at 2150 rpm, EGTs 1050-1200°F, May 22, 2024). Earlier tune revisions hit 1350°F+ EGTs towing 5000 lbs and had a turbo hiss at idle.
Injector Knock: The H&S tune caused injector knock, which the EFI Live tune fixed, but Corey preferred the H&S’s economy and power.
The Solution (Simplified):
Diagnostic Review Setup:
Logan initiated a diagnostic review (Jan 10, 2024), sending a BBX file (All Diesel BBX 1.13.23.bbx) for Corey’s Flashscan to log data (Jan 15, 2024). Corey sent two logs (CMC_0016.pld, CMC_0018.pld, Jan 17, 2024) from the non-PPEI tune.
Log Analysis:
Kory reviewed the logs (Jan 18, 2024) and saw no glaring issues but noted the BD Screamer’s larger VGT likely reduced economy slightly, a common trade-off. He suspected the other tuner’s tune lacked optimal timing and used excessive vane position in cruising ranges, hurting efficiency.
Further Data Requested:
Corey couldn’t log new data due to snow (Jan 17, 2024) but offered older logs. Logan encouraged more logs under specific conditions (cruising, low economy) to pinpoint the issue (Jan 18, 2024).
Corey observed boost fluctuations while towing (May 22, 2024, no trailer) but didn’t have his Flashscan. He planned to log hills or WOT pulls once retrieved, ideally over the weekend (May 29, 2024).
Recommendations:
Logan suggested the tuner increase timing and reduce vane position in cruising ranges to improve economy (May 29, 2024). No PPEI tune was provided, as this was a diagnostic review of another company’s calibration.
Outcome:
No resolution confirmed, as Corey hadn’t sent new logs. The advice to adjust timing and vane settings was meant to guide the other tuner toward better economy and power.
Next Step:
Corey retrieves his Flashscan and records a log (cruising at 60-70 mph, light throttle, capturing RPM, boost, EGTs, and fuel quantity) on the current non-PPEI tune, sending it to support@teamppei.zohodesk.com. PPEI analyzes it to confirm if timing or vane issues persist and advises the tuner on specific calibration tweaks to target 12-14 L/100km and restore power feel."

Harsh Downshifts and Surging: Brent Lane, with a 2013 Chevrolet Silverado LML (VIN: 1GC1KYE83DF171971), reported issues with his Green Diesel Engineering (GDE) ECM/TCM tunes (Nov 4, 2024). These included harsh 6-4 downshifts at 50-70 mph, surging in 5th gear under full throttle (rail pressure fluctuating 25-30k psi), and shuddering when lugging in 6th at 45 mph. He switched to PPEI for a 100hp tune.
TCM Tune Loading: Brent’s AutoCal was linked to GDE, causing errors ($0525, $0536) when loading PPEI’s tune (Nov 15, 2024). He needed an unlink code and PPEI’s link code.
Towing Complaints: After installing PPEI’s TCM tune (Dec 12, 2024), Brent towed 7500 lbs (Jan 20, 2025) and noted:
Premature upshifts to 5th on grades at 60+ mph, spiking EGTs.
Late downshifts with exhaust brake (1400-1450 RPM vs. desired 1600+ RPM), causing low torque exiting corners.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial ECM Tune Fix:
Brent sent logs (Nov 7, 2024) showing surging and downshift issues. Kory identified poor rail pressure scaling for the BD Venom CP3 (Nov 13, 2024), sending a 100hp tune (DST_105circ.ctz).
Revised tune (DST_105circ_cp3_2.ctz, Dec 3) resolved mid-throttle surge but showed low rail pressure (19k psi) at full throttle. Logs (Dec 3, E86A_A50_0021.pld) confirmed improved performance.
TCM Tune Loading:
Brent got an unlink code from GDE and used PPEI’s link code (Nov 25, 2024) to flash the TCM tune (A50_6711OS_HP_4.0.ctz, Dec 12). Errors ($0525, $0536) were fixed by updating EFILive (Nov 15).
Towing Adjustments:
Brent reported towing issues (Jan 20, 2025). Logan requested logs to diagnose upshift/downshift timing, noting tow/haul mode might need tweaking.
Brent couldn’t tow soon but offered to log in tow/haul on flat ground (Jan 20) to replicate low RPM downshifts.
Next Action:
Brent records logs (idle, cruising, heavy throttle) in tow/haul mode, focusing on 5th gear upshifts and exhaust brake downshifts.
PPEI adjusts TCM tune to delay 4-5 upshifts on grades and trigger downshifts at ~1600 RPM for better torque.
Next Step:
Brent records and sends data logs in tow/haul mode, and PPEI revises the TCM tune to optimize shift points for towing, ensuring no EGT spikes or low-RPM lugging."

Shifting Hesitation: Kolten Heck, owner of a 2015 Ram 3500 with an Aisin transmission, reported on January 30, 2025, that the current PPEI TCM tune causes a ""horrible"" hesitation during the 1-2 gear shift. He wants a firmer, more positive shift between all gears to eliminate this issue.
Lack of Order Details: Kolten purchased the truck secondhand and received PPEI tunes from the previous owner, so he lacks a purchase order number, complicating PPEI’s ability to verify his setup (Jan 31, 2025).
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Response:
Logan couldn’t find Kolten’s details in PPEI’s system (Jan 31, 2025) and requested the full VIN and order number to confirm the tune version.
Kolten responded (Jan 31) that he has no order number due to the secondhand purchase but sent screenshots (likely of EZ Lynk app showing tune profiles).
Shifting Fix:
Logan advised a proper transmission relearn to address the 1-2 shift hesitation, noting that such issues often stem from incomplete learning or subpar engine tuning (Jan 31).
He asked about the current engine tuning to rule out ECM interference with the TCM.
Next Action:
Kolten needs to provide the VIN and clarify his engine tuning (e.g., PPEI, another tuner, or stock).
Perform a transmission relearn using EZ Lynk to reset adaptives (clear KAM and drive ~50-100 miles).
If hesitation persists, PPEI can revise the TCM tune for firmer shifts, targeting a more positive 1-2 transition.
Next Step:
Kolten shares the VIN and engine tuning details, performs the relearn, and reports back to Logan. PPEI then adjusts the TCM tune if needed to ensure firm, smooth gear shifts.

Note: This issue aligns with past discussions on analyzing vehicle diagnostic data (April 2, 2025), where shift hesitation could be linked to TCM adaptives or ECM tuning mismatches. While not directly referencing Kolten’s logs, a similar approach—diagnosing via relearn and verifying tune compatibility—applies here."
265650000124349136,PPEI Diagnostic Review - Order #N10547,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Idle Lope Issue: Austin Gribler reported that his heavily modified Ford 6.7L Powerstroke (year not specified, VIN ending 2268) lopes aggressively at idle once the engine warms up, resembling a 2.6 pulling truck. This started after installing a built long block, 200% S&S injectors, H&S dual fueler, 10mm stroker CP4, and other mods (May 21, 2024). At 0.4% throttle, the lope stops, and injector graphs (via Ford IDS) show stable operation.
Tuning Struggles: Multiple tuners (Proven, Tyrant, others) couldn’t resolve the idle issue despite Austin sharing injector flow sheets. The ECM tune wasn’t calibrated for the oversized injectors, causing fueling problems at idle.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Diagnosis:
Logan requested data logs (May 21, 2024) with a PIDs file (6.7 ford channels2.Channels.Channels.xml) to capture the lope issue. Austin sent a log (Austin_Gribler_PPEI_Scan_vin2268.hpl, May 24, 2024) via HP Tuners from a friend’s shop.
Kory analyzed the log (May 28, 2024) and found the ECM tune wasn’t set for the 200% injectors. Rail pressure was stock-level (too low), and fuel quantity dropped to zero at idle due to overfueling, causing the lope. He advised fixing the ECM tune first.
Tune Revision:
Austin informed his ECM tuner (unspecified, possibly Ben Paul per Jonathan Chasse’s case) of Kory’s findings. A revised tune was flashed, improving idle stability initially, but the lope returned with heat buildup (May 28, 2024). At 0.4% throttle, it still cleared up.
Austin noted the new tune made the truck sound more like a 6.7 Powerstroke and idle longer before loping, but the core issue persisted.
Data Log Limitation:
Austin offered to send another log via EZ Lynk 2.0 (May 28, 2024), but Logan clarified HP Tuners logs were needed for proper analysis (May 28, 2024). Austin planned to revisit his friend’s shop for this (May 28, 2024).
Phone Support Request:
Austin requested a phone call (573-450-3061, May 28, 2024) to discuss further, indicating unresolved questions about the tune or next steps.
Next Step:
Austin visits his friend’s shop to record a new HP Tuners data log capturing the idle lope (0% throttle, warm engine) and 0.4% throttle stability, sending it to support@teamppei.zohodesk.com. PPEI reviews it to confirm if the ECM tuner adjusted rail pressure and fuel quantity correctly. Logan or Ryan may call Austin to discuss findings and suggest further ECM tune tweaks or check for mechanical issues (e.g., injector wiring, CP4 health).

Note: The lope aligns with tuning challenges for oversized injectors, as seen in other tickets (e.g., Daniel Gonzalez’s 90% injector issues). A precise ECM calibration is critical, and Austin’s call request suggests PPEI’s direct input could finalize the fix. If you have more tickets, I can dig for $0502 or similar injector-related resolutions!"

265650000085904001,Adjustment of TCM Tune Shift Timing for 2015.5 LML Duramax Transmission,"<div style=""direction: ltr; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><div><p dir=""auto"" style="""">Rodney Weaver contacted PPEI regarding a transmission control module (TCM) tune for his 2015.5 LML Duramax (order #N1714). On October 6, 2022, S Thomas requested a picture of the white plate on the TCM, located on the driver’s side of the fan shroud, to complete the order. Rodney provided the TCM tune file (Rodney Weaver_LML2015.5_533616_4899OS_SP_4.0.ctz), along with additional files including loading instructions (Loading LML T87 TCM Tune onto your AutoCal files.pdf), flashing procedure (Autocal Flashing Procedure.docx), and a BBX file (DURAMAX_All Diesel BBX 2.12.22.bbx). S Thomas then sent the finalized TCM tune file and instructions. On October 10, 2022, Rodney reported that the transmission tune, when floored from a standstill, delayed shifting from 4th to 5th gear until the engine exceeded redline, around 3500 RPM. He requested an adjustment to shift out of 4th gear sooner, before 3000 RPM, at wide-open throttle (WOT), while expressing overall satisfaction with the tune otherwise. Zach Lejeune responded, requesting a data log to diagnose the issue, attaching instructions for logging (how to get a DataLog 1 1.pdf).</p></div></div>","PPEI addressed Rodney’s request for a TCM tune and his subsequent concern about shift timing.

265650000126265538,PPEI Tuning  - Order #N11093 - 13 LML TCM Tune,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Shifting and Stutter Issues: Michal Piotrowski reported persistent issues with his LML Duramax (VIN: 1GT220C80DZ133105) starting July 9, 2024, including lazy/slow shifts, excessive throttle needed for downshifts, lugging (no downshift), and engine stutter (feeling like lost gear or rail pressure) at various conditions (e.g., 2500 RPM, 60-65 mph). Logs showed issues like long shift delays and hitting a limiter.
Severe Shaking Incident: On September 5, 2024, while logging, the truck experienced a catastrophic episode: after a forced downshift, it shook aggressively, sounded like knocking, and felt like a mechanical failure. It misfired, wouldn’t upshift from 4-5, and seemed to lose rail pressure or injector function. Restarting resolved it, with no check engine light (CEL).
Injector and Rail Concerns: Logs indicated injector rattle (2-7 seconds in), poor rail pressure control (noted July 25, 2024), and possible fuel/air/trans issues, though Kory later suspected electrical causes (Sep 7, 2024).
Tuner Dispute: Michal’s ECM tuner (Cody Hawk) claimed the issues weren’t tune-related since the truck ran fine before, prompting Michal to seek PPEI’s analysis of logs for TCM vs. mechanical issues.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Diagnosis:
Cody sent logs (Jul 9, 2024) showing stutter, lazy shifts, and power loss. Kory identified ECM tuning issues, particularly rail pressure mismanagement, and suggested testing a stock TCM file (1GT220C80DZ133105_TCM STOCK.ctz, Jul 9).
Michal confirmed (Jul 24) that the stock file reduced some issues (e.g., downshift lag) but sputter and lugging persisted, suggesting ECM or mechanical problems.
Further Logs and ECM Tuning:
Kory reviewed logs (Jul 25) and confirmed ECM tuning was “100%” at fault for rail issues, advising Michal to coordinate with Cody. No mechanical failure was evident then.
Michal sent more logs (Sep 5-6, 2024) capturing 3-4 shift flares, injector noise, and the shaking incident (logs E86A_A50_0134-0136.pld). He noted prior cracked pistons, fearing recurrence.
Shaking Incident Analysis:
Kory analyzed logs (Sep 7, 2024) and saw RPM shake but no clear fuel/air/trans errors. Low turbo vane positions hinted at issues, but he leaned toward an electrical problem (e.g., wiring, injector harness) rather than tuning.
Logan recommended (Sep 6, 2024) reverting to the OEM/stock TCM file and taking the truck to a qualified shop for electrical diagnostics, as the issue wasn’t tune-related.
Outcome:
No follow-up from Michal post-Sep 6, 2024, suggests he may have pursued shop diagnostics. PPEI ruled out TCM tuning as the cause, focusing on potential electrical or injector issues.
Next Step:
Michal loads the stock TCM file, visits a shop for electrical diagnostics (checking injector wiring, ECM connections, or fuel system), and reports findings to PPEI. If issues persist, PPEI can review new logs to assist Cody with ECM tune adjustments."

Zach Lejeune asked if the truck was deleted, which Jimmy confirmed. Zach explained that, due to the EPA’s stance on emissions-removed tuning, PPEI could not adjust the tuning for the CP3 conversion on a deleted truck. He suggested that reinstalling emissions equipment would allow PPEI to provide the necessary tuning adjustments. Jimmy expressed disappointment, noting that his EFI Live device was likely locked to his vehicle’s VIN, and asked for alternative recommendations. Zach advised that reinstalling emissions would be the safest option, as the quality of emissions-removed tuning had declined and could lead to future issues. He highlighted that emissions-compliant tuning would offer power, efficiency, and reliable support, unlike potentially unreliable emissions-removed tuning options. Zach also offered to unlink Jimmy’s EFI Live device for use with another company, requesting the device’s serial number to provide unlinking codes.

265650000133738440,PPEI Tuning  - Order #N12962 - 16 Ram 6.7L  - Lance Foster,No description provided,"The Problem (Simplified):
Bricked ECM: Sierra Nevada Diesel Performance (SNDP) ordered tunes for a 2016 Ram Aisin Cab & Chassis (VIN: 3C7WRNBL0GG277812, order #N13512) on October 8, 2024. After attempting to flash a PPEI tune, the ECM became unresponsive, throwing a $0549 error (Invalid Calibration). SNDP replaced the ECM at a $2500 cost to keep the customer’s truck running.
Tune Selection Issue: SNDP requested CSP switchable tuning, but PPEI clarified (Oct 8, 2024) that CSP isn’t available for 2016 Aisin C&C models, offering all HP levels or a single tune instead.
TCM Tune Loading: TCM tunes (2016 68273121AE SA6CR4362 Aisin-AS69RC DD DF DP Cab-Chassis 4X4 v1.1.4.ctz) and stock file were sent (Jan 8, 2025), but no confirmation of successful loading due to ECM focus.
Refund Request: SNDP requested a refund for tuning costs (Jan 24, 2025), having switched to another tuner due to the ECM issue and delays.
The Solution (Simplified):
Initial Tune Attempt:
SNDP confirmed no CSP option (Oct 8, 2024) and proceeded with tuning. They provided an AutoCal link code (SN: 006000764519, Oct 15) to flash PPEI files.
The tune attempt failed with $0549 (Oct 16), and codes U1197 (Security Seed Failure), C2206 (Config Mismatch), U0100 (Lost ECM Comm), and B2206 (VIN Mismatch) appeared. Ryan sent a stock file (3C7WRNBL0GG277812_STOCK_31321631AG.ctz) to recover, but the ECM remained unresponsive.
ECM Recovery:
SNDP shipped the ECM to PPEI (Nov 13, 2024, RMA issued). Paul recovered it with a stock file and flashed a 60hp tune (Dec 2), but the CSP tune left it unresponsive again (Dec 3). No other codes beyond $0549 were noted.
PPEI shipped the ECM back (Dec 3, tracking: 1Z7F0V280309268723), unopened and stock, as SNDP had moved to a new ECM (Jan 27, 2025).
Refund and Resolution:
SNDP requested a full refund (Jan 24, 2025). Paul advised covering costs only (Jan 27). Logan refunded 50% of the tune cost ($386.73, Jan 27) as a goodwill gesture, noting SNDP’s good dealer status.
TCM tunes were provided (Jan 8), but SNDP likely didn’t use them, having switched tuners.
Outcome:
The ECM was returned in its original state (Jan 27, 2025), suitable for return or reuse. No further action was taken on TCM tuning due to SNDP’s new tuner choice.
Next Step:
SNDP confirms receipt of the refunded ECM and $386.73. If they wish to retry PPEI tuning, they can flash the TCM file (2016 68273121AE SA6CR4362 Aisin-AS69RC DD DF DP Cab-Chassis 4X4 v1.1.4.ctz) and coordinate with PPEI for support, though they’ve moved to another tuner"
